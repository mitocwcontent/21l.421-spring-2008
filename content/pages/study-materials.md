| Marciano, Lisa. "The Serious Comedy of Twelfth Night: Dark did Acticism in Illyria." _Renascence_ 56, no. 1 (Fall 2003): 3-19. | Abstract: "Close scrutiny of the dramas indicates that, beginning as early Love's Labour's Lost and continuing in into the romances, Shakespeare's comic characters repeatedly come face to face with mortality, learn that one must, therefore, live well, and teach others wisdom accordingly. Having a brush with death and urging others to live wisely are staples of Shakespeare's comedies. Here, Marciano examines reasons behind the dark dimensions that pervade Shakespeare's _Twelfth Night_." |
| Ake, Jami. "Glimpsing a 'lesbian' Poetics in Twelfth Night." _Studies in English Literature 1500-1900_ 43, no. 2 (Spring 2003): 375-394. | Abstract: "This essay argues that the interview scene between Olivia and the disguised Viola in Shakespeare's _Twelfth Night_ (I.v) offers an often overlooked opportunity to witness the dynamics by which a language of female-female desire emerges from the materials of conventional heteroerotic discourses. Viola's successful wooing of Olivia in this scene allows us a glimpse of tentative "lesbian" poetics as one female character imagines and articulates the words that will seduce another and inspire her to erotic action." |

| [![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262520249) Bakhtin, M.M. "Rabelais in the History of Laughter." In [_Rabelais and His World_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262520249). Translated by Helene Iswolsky. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1971, pp. 66-96. ISBN: 9780262520249. | Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975) was one of a group of Russian thinkers (some of whom he mentions here) who were responding to Russian Formalist ideas. Literature, for Bakhtin, is a formal structural system, but also part of the ideological/historical place and movement that produces it. In this excerpt from Chapter One of _Rabelais and His World_ (1941; translated 1965), Bakhtin discusses the medieval feasts and festivals, such as the Feast of Fools and (my favorite) Feast of the Ass. This healing, regenerating "lower body" laughter eventually moves from the marketplace to "great literature", such as Rabelais' novel Gargantuan and Pantagruel (1530's-50's) where, Bakhtin says, "It became the form of a new free and critical consciousness." (97) Thus, the social and historical practice is translated to a literary form. |
| Bergson, Henri. "From Laughter." In _Comedy: Meaning and Form_. Edited by Robert W. Corrigan. San Francisco, CA: Chandler Publishing Company, 1965. pp. 471-477. | Henri Bergson (1859-1941) was a French philosopher. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1927. This excerpt from his essay on laughter (1900) emphasizes the human, and indeed the socially specific, as necessary to the comic effect. This idea perhaps reveals a connection to his philosophical work, in which reality has to be seen as historical and contingent. You may find his ideas on the mechanical in comedy relevant to the film _Modern Times_. |
| Freud, Sigmund. Excerpts from Chapter VI "Jokes, Dreams and the Unconscious" and Chapter VII "Jokes and the Comic." In _Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious_. Freud Standard ed. Edited by Strachey, et al. London, UK: Hogarth Press, 1975, pp. 171-177, 188-203, and 221-236. ISBN: 9780701200671. | Freud devoted an entire book-length study to Jokes (1905). Jokes constitute for Freud a kind of disguise, and thus a kind of interpretation. They share this quality with dreams, and in this way demonstrate their dependence on the unconscious. He distinguishes Jokes from Comedy and Humour, which belong to the preconscious, and do not rely on a compromise with repressed content. These excerpts from chapters VI and VII discuss Jokes, the Comic, and Humour, respectively. Under Humour you will find references to Mark Twain, Don Quixote and Falstaff. Along the way you will also see references to many other works, including Bergson's. |
| Meredith, George. "Prelude: A Chapter of Which the Last Page Only is of Any Importance." In _The Egoist_ (1879). New York, NY: Penguin Classics, 1979. ISBN: 9780140430349. | George Meredith (1808-1909) was a late Victorian novelist and poet, author of the sonnet sequence _Modern Love_ (1862). This "Prelude" from his novel _The Egoist_ (1879) reveals his cool, gnomic style, which may take getting used to. The subtitle of _The Egoist_ (a 3 volume novel) is "A Comedy in Narrative," and you may hear the strong, impish narrative voice, deeply associative and loaded with irony. He is not a realist. The "Comic Spirit" in the Prelude condenses critical knowledge, shocks us out of our routine, and aims at all that is rigid and egoistic, via a sense of archaism and surprise (compare Bergson and Freud). In so doing, the Comic Spirit breathes life into a moribund culture. Meredith's work bears the marks of strong disenchantment of the late Romantic, the crisis of faith. You can compare him with Thomas Hardy, a writer he championed. |
